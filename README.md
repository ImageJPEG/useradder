This project is designed to create a Python based, Active Directory mass user adder.

The goals of this project are:
Have useradder read a text file, line by line, to add a list of users into Active Directory.
Simplicity - Be able to execute program with text file, example: “useradder.py user list.cvs”. Must also have the text file be easily editable for any human to add users to.
